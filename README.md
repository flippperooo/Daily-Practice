# Daily-Practice

Daily-Practice

In this directory, I was going to commit everyday 
and not just once a day, as many times as I possibly could a day,
without making fake changes like a single period or anything like that.

Although I believe I will be committing earlier than necessary,
compared to professional practices, the intent right now is not to be professional with my commits,
but to be professional with my documentation (commit messages) and consistent with my activity.

All commits and contents of commits will be made by me, and creators will be credited if 
I use assets from a source other than myself.

I will be interweaving everything I make into one large project: every web page 
and every coding exercise I do. I will link to a single index.html. Except for the 
tricks repo.

This index.html will double as my resume.
The main focus of this repo is consistency and muscle memory.
Some website concepts may be repeated,
likely with slightly different approaches each time.

I also intend on documenting every little thing thoroughly.
Every commit message will likely be a little verbose, unless
the commit is extremely simple. These commits will not be formatted 
in a way that only describes the code, but also describes the things 
I’m learning, don’t understand, or intend on doing in the future.

Quality or Quantity?
No.
Quality quantity.

Yes, I’m committing every day. But not only this repo.
Split between this repo and the Tricks repo.

The tricks site is what i really want to complete.
